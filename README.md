# WebTraffic-Detection
Using the network simulator NS2, the attacks in the WSN can be replicated. NS2 makes a  replica of a real time network. It is a time-based event driven simulator. The code can be written  in such a way that at a particular time, what particular event can happen. The data transfer  between the nodes and the attacks can be shown.
